## Algorithms Implemented

This repository includes the following machine learning algorithms:

- [Adaboost](Adaboost-Algorithm.ipynb)
- [Bagging using Random Forests](Bagging using Random Forests.ipynb)
- [Decision Tree](DecisionTree.ipynb)
- [K-Means Clustering](K-means Clustering.ipynb)
- [Logistic Regression](Logistic_Regression.ipynb)
- [Random Forest](RandomForest.ipynb)
- [Support Vector Machine (SVM)](SVM.ipynb)
- [Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for Classification](classification using Multilayer perceptron.ipynb)

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook. To use these implementations:

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/harsh-git1610/MachineLearning-Algo-implementation.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd MachineLearning-Algo-implementation
    ```

3.  Open and run the desired Jupyter Notebook using Jupyter:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    Or using JupyterLab:

    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

4.  Follow the instructions and comments within the notebook to understand and execute the algorithm.

## Installation

To run the Jupyter Notebooks, you will need to have Python and Jupyter installed. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

1.  **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Jupyter**:

    ```bash
    pip install jupyter
    ```

4.  **Install required libraries**:
    While the specific libraries needed may vary slightly for each notebook, common libraries include `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`. Install these using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
